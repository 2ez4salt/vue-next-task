# Tarfin Javascript Developer Task

Your task is to build basic table component with search, pagination and sort features.

This project created with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).
Vite currently only works with Vue 3.x. (Keep in mind)
- Use `npm run dev` to run the development server.

Receive events from Ticketmaster API (https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/) with search keyword (cinema, football, etc.) (https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/#search-events-v2) and show api results on your table component. Create event detail page with event details including title, price, place etc. Then add show detail button or icon to the table component for routing to the event detail page. 

**Project requirements**
* Build your table component from scratch. You can't use any existing vue component for this project.
* Component must be has search capabilities. (Split your components into small components.) 
* Component must be has pagination.
* You need to add event detail page. Don't forget to add show detail action to the table component.
* You must write tests for your code. (We recommend to use Jest for tests)
* You can add sorting feature to the table component. This feature is not must but big bonus. (If you decided to add sorting feature make sure sorting mechanism works without API request.)
* You can use `bootstrap` or `tailwindcss` as CSS framework.
* Axios or any other alternatives can be use for HTTP requests.
